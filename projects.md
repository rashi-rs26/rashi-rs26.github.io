- **Payment Mechanism in Knapsack Auctions**  
	Prof. G. Sajith, IIT Guwahati
	1. Devised a frugal mechanism for Knapsack Auctions, which minimizes the payments.
    2. Constructed Knapsack graph by reducing the knapsack problem to costliest path problem on a directed acyclic network.
    3. By leveraging on the most optimal solution, minimised the payments being made to the agents to keep the mechanism incentive compatible.

- **Text Readability Analysis using Language Models**  
	Prof. Ashish Anand, IIT Guwahati
	1. Designed a new fine-grained, computational measure of readability. Main conjecture was that the predictability of a text, as determined by standard language models, is a viable metric of its readability.
    2. Evaluated our metric on various datasets with known readability scores, such as simple and standard Wikipedia articles, labeled datasets from prior work on automatic readability scoring systems, and even created a new dataset by parsing freely available school textbooks.
    3. Obtained good results for all the three datasets, unlike earlier approaches.

- **Monitoring production line performance to reduce failures**  
	Prof. Rashmi Dutta Baruah, IIT Guwahati
	1. In this work, we pose the task of fault detection as a binary classification problem. The features include numerical, categorical, and timestamp features, and hence warranty a combination of several techniques for efficiently solving the problem.
    2. First, a biased sampling method is used to reduce the effect of skewed data distribution. Thereafter, the categorical features are represented as 3 numerical features using sparse online classification algorithms: stochastic truncated gradient (STG), forward-backward splitting (FOBOS), and enhanced regularized dual averaging (ERDA).
    3. Once features are obtained, we try several classification methods like SVM and feed-forward networks to perform the fault detection. Finally, the overall objective is optimized using a Bayesian optimization technique.
